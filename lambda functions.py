# lambda functions are used to get inputs do a small amount of processing
# and return outputs
# functions can peform an action or they can return an output

def divide(x, y):
    return x / y



divide = lambda x, y: x/ y
#doing this means you don't need the code above ^^^^^
# lambda functions provide more simplicity to codes or sometimes make it complicated
